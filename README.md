# Assignment 3 – Rails Basics

The overall goal of this assignment is to implement a Rails based application that fetches data from a JSON based API and presents it using a Heroku hosted website.

# Functional Requirements
1. The application fetches data from a JSON based API of your choice
2. The website has only 2 active pages; index and details
3. The index page shows the fetched data in a table format
4. The index page should be requested with at least one parameter to narrow down the results shown
5. Each entry in the index page has a link that opens a details page showing more information for this entry
6. Each entry should have an image associated with it; either in the index or details page (or both)
7. Use CSS to style the webpages
   
# Bonus:
• Integrate bootstrap (v. 3 or 4) using a bootstrap gem
• Use bootstrap classes to enhance the visual appearance of the website
• Use bootstrap responsive classes to make the website responsive

# Technical Requirements
1. The application has a single controller with two actions
2. The application has a single model file that implement all methods used to fetch the required data
3. The application is hosted on Heroku
4. CSS should be in a stylesheet (do not use inline styling)
5. Add all project files in a zip archive and upload to Avenue
6. Provide the link to the Heroku hosted website in your submission
7. Include any special instructions necessary to run the application in your submission

The web application is based on Cartoon Rick and Morty series and the index page displays the characters of the Rick and Morty series. The index page is filtered with search term by name of the character i.e "rick" by default. When clicked on "More  Details" link the user is navigated to the details page where more information about the selected character will be displayed.
